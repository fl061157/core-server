            <p class="txt_head1">The Terms and Privacy are subject to change</p>

            <p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.</p>

            <p>You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. ChatGame may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.</p>

            <p>We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service. Changes to the fair usage policies and/or Additional Terms will be posted on ChatGame’s Website <a class="http://www.chatgame.me" target="_blank">https://ChatGame.me</a> or other means. The changes will be effective when published. Please review the Terms on a regular basis.  You understand and agree that your express acceptance of the Terms or your use of the Software, Product, Services, and/or ChatGame Website after the date of publication shall constitute your agreement to the updated Terms.</p>

            <p class="txt_head1">Your Account</p>

            <p>In order to access and use the features of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you will have to provide ChatGame with your mobile phone number. When providing your mobile phone number, you must provide accurate and complete information. You hereby give your express consent to ChatGame to access your contact list and/or address book for mobile phone numbers in order to provide and use the Service.

You must notify ChatGame immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your mobile phone. Although ChatGame will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of ChatGame or others due to such unauthorized use.</p>

            <p class="txt_head1">Account Deactivation</p>

            <p>If you do not want to use the Service any more, you may, at any time, request for the termination of the Terms and Privacy by emailing <a href="mailto:support@chatgame.me">support@chatgame.me</a>  and in such case, ChatGame will terminate the Terms and Privacy in a swift manner as required under the relevant laws and regulations.</p>
            <p>Upon the termination of the Terms and Privacy, unless it is required to preserve your information under the relevant laws and/or the ChatGame Privacy Policy, your information and any and all data provided by you, such as postings prepared by you, etc., may or may not be deleted to the extent necessary to provide the Services to other remaining users in a normal manner.</p>

            <p class="txt_head1">Your Content and Responsibility:</p>

            <p>ChatGame believes that your content has useful information and that it is very important to ensure that such content is accessed by lawful process and means. If you post any content on the Services, you will be deemed to have granted to ChatGame and its partners a worldwide and permanent license to use, store, copy, modify, transmit, disclose, demonstrate or display in public, distribute, create any derivative works from or permit other users to use such content. This license will survive even after you cease to use the Services or deactivate your ChatGame account. For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted to ChatGame and its partners under such license will be used only for the purposes of the operation, improvement and promotion of the Services and the development of new ChatGame services.</p>

            <p>You understand that even if you seek to delete Your Content from our services, it may as a technical and administrative matter take some time or not be possible to achieve this.</p>

            <p>You can find more information about how ChatGame uses and stores your content in the ChatGame Privacy Policy or you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@chatgame.me">support@chatgame.me</a></p>

            <p>You should have acquired all legal rights necessary for you to be able to grant a license to ChatGame to use the content you provided to ChatGame, and you may not disclose or post any content that is pornographic or violates public order, laws or good morals.</p>

            <p>If ChatGame determines that the content you have provided violates relevant laws or ChatGame’s policies, ChatGame may delete or refuse to post such content; provided, however, that, ChatGame is not obliged to review all of your content.</p>

            <p>The Services may include content that is not owned by ChatGame. In such case, the individual who has provided such content will solely be liable for such content.
                Your use of the Services does not grant you any right to the content provided by other users. To use other users’ content made available through the Services, you must separately obtain the permission from the owner thereof.
            </p>

            <p class="txt_head1">Intellectual Property Rights</p>

            <p>The design of the ChatGame Service along with ChatGame created text, scripts, graphics, interactive features and the like, except Status Submissions (as defined below), and the trademarks, service marks and logos contained therein ("Marks"), are owned by or licensed to ChatGame, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under United States and foreign laws and international conventions. The Service is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal use only. ChatGame reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service. You agree to not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Service other than expressly permitted herein, including any use, copying, or distribution of Status Submissions of third parties obtained through the Service for any commercial purposes.</p>

            <p class="txt_head1">Warranty and Disclaimer </p>

            <p>In providing the Services, ChatGame exercises reasonable precaution to help you enjoy the Services to their fullest extent possible.</p>

            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, ChatGame expressly disclaims any and all promises or warranties of any kind regarding matters not set forth in the Terms and Privacy.

            <p class="txt_head1">Liability of our services and application: </p>

            <p>In no event shall ChatGame, its officers, directors, employees, or any agents, be liable to you for any direct, indirect, incidental, special punitive, or consequential damages whatsoever resulting from any (i) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content, (ii) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to an use of our services, (iii) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information and/or financial information stored therein, (iv) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from our severs, (v) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the link, which may be transmitted to or through our services by any third party, (vi) any errors or omissions as a result of your use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the ChatGame app or website, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, and whether or not the company is advised of the possibility of such damages, and/or (vii) the disclosure of information pursuant to these Terms and Privacy or privacy policy.</p>

            <p class="txt_head1">Termination</p>

            <p>These Terms will apply to your use of our services until access to the relevant services is terminated by either you or us.</p>

            <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to your account or any or all of our services: (i) if we reasonably believe that you have breached these Terms; (ii) if your use of our services creates risk for us or for other users of our services, gives rise to a threat of potential third party claims against us or is potentially damaging to our reputation; (iii) for any other reason. Where reasonably practicable, we will give you notice of any suspension or termination.</p>

            <p>Following termination of these Terms, we will only retain and use Your Content in accordance with these Terms, in particular the <a href="#01">ChatGame Privacy Policy</a>. Where we suspend or terminate a service, or where your access to our services is terminated by you or us, we do not guarantee that we will be able to return any of Your Content back to you and we may permanently delete Your Content without notice to you at any time after termination. Please ensure that you regularly back up Your Content.</p>
